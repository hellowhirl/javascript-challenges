## (1) Recursion


Recursion is a concept that is used often in programming. What it's basically doing is *calling a function on itself*.

The typical example of recursion in action is a simple factorial function. For example, the factorial of 4 = 24 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4).
With this factorial program we want to be able to input any number into a form and spit out the correct factorial in the browser. Since factorials are made of integers we want to do validation and round any decimal number to the nearest integer.
